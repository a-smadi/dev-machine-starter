# dev-machine-starter

A script to help get things up and running for a fresh installation of my Linux or macOS machines.

## About

This script was written with my specific requirements in mind, to help setup my home and work machines, however i believe the packages listed as essentials and favorites are both very handy and useful to everyone.

## Running the script

The script works perfectly for Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 LTS as well as macOS Catalina, and can be easily run as such:

```
./setup.sh
```
